    "Q1: Show that the correlation co-efficient is indeed related to the fraction of varaince explained by a linear dependence.\n",
    "1) To start, make a N(0,1) random variable x, with 200,000 entries. Then make a linearly dependent variable yi=axi+ni, where a is some amplitude, and ni is a random noise varaible. Assume that ni is distributed as N(0,n), where n is the noise level.\n",
    "Calculate the correlation co-efficient rxy between x and y for 40 different values of n, logarithmically spaced between 0.01 and 100. (hint use np.logspace).\n",
    "Plot rxy versus the inverse of the noise n normalized by the standard devaition of the signal axi: asxn You may want to use ax.loglog to visualize the orders of magnitude.\n",
    "Comment on the resulting comparison.\n",
